Instructions for releasing LXR

The easiest way to make a release is to use the makerelease.pl script
from the lxr-tools package.

The steps are:

- Run all the tests & ensure they pass
- Tag the release in CVS with a tag of the form release-x-y-z (e.g. release-0-9-4)
- Export the tagged files to a new directory lxr-x-y-z
- Create the Changelog: can use cvs2cl.pl script
- tar up the files
- upload to SF servers
- upload new changelog
- send release notification
- Update the tracker version numbers (bugs etc) so defects can be reported
