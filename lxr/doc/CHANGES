This file draws your attention on changes made
which could impact your existing trees.

If they result in an incompatibility, you must reindex your tree.

        =====================
        LXR 1.1  -->  LXR 1.2
        =====================

Language parsers
----------------
Include processing restructured to avoid infinite loop if source does
not match internal grammar; now shared between the languages
Syntax of Java import corrected
C/C++ parsing separated from generic parser
Awk parser enabled
New HTML parser to correct a serious flaw in hyperlink generation
												=> reindexing recommended

Custom icons
------------
New parameter 'parenticon' to define an icon for parent directories
												=> no impact

User'Manual
-----------
Updated to reflect new 1.2 features; separately downloadable on SourceFourge.
Please, read it; a lot of time has been invested in its writing.

        =====================
        LXR 1.0  -->  LXR 1.1
        =====================

Easy upgrade
------------
Since the database definition did not change between 1.0 and 1.1,
you can upgrade without reconfiguring not reindexing.
1/ Save lxr.conf and other customised files (mainly apache-lxrserver.conf
   and lighttpd-lxrserver.conf)
2/ Install the new release.
3/ Reload lxr.conf and other saved customised files
4/ Restart your web server

User'Manual
-----------
Updated to reflect new 1.1 features; separately downloadable on SourceFourge.
Please, read it; a lot of time has been invested in its writing.

Installation
------------
Few user-visible changes, instructions for 1.0 still valid
Better web server configuration taking into account the way are described
in lxr.conf
Configuration can disable free-text search if no search engine is detected,
allowing to test LXR without the burden of installing a text search engine
Script configure-lxr.pl modified so that all (configuration) templates are
processed the same. Extended macro language (now called LCL) well defined
and made easily readable.

Directory and file view, identifier cross-references
----------------------------------------------------
Visual feedback if file is newer than cross-reference database (useful
to developers to warn about erroneous line number references in changed
files); cross-references may be fixed by running again genxref
												=> needs to rebuild database
Note: to avoid the pain of manually reconfiguring LXR, read the tip
====| about "rebuilding LXR databases" on http://lxr.sourceforge.net

Extended exclusion rules
------------------------
'ignorefiles' added to hide files. Like 'ignoredirs', operates only
on the final segment of file path.
'filterdirs' and 'filterfiles' added to operate on the complete path.

Identifier search
-----------------
Query extended to show approximate matches differing in case

Language parsers
----------------
Ant, asm, Fortran, Java, JavaScript, Make, Pascal, PHP, SQL enabled

Mercurial.pm: NEW NEW NEW
-------------
Experimental support for Mercurial VCS.
Repository restricted to directory in the local file system, no network
access allowed.
Note: this preliminary implementation runs horribly sloooooooow on directory
====| listing (rougly 0.5 seconds per line). The problem lies in function
    | getdir(). Though it is similar to Subversion's, it does not run with
    | the expected speed.
    | Please send suggestions for improvement.

        ======================
        LXR 0.11  -->  LXR 1.0
        ======================

User'Manual
-----------
Simultaneously available; separately downloadable on SourceFourge.
Please, read it; a lot of time has been invested in its writing.

Directory renaming: CAUTION - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE - CAUTION
------------------
Former directory 'lxrconf.d' changed to 'custom.d' to reduce
confusion with configuration file 'lxr.conf'.
												=> no impact for new users

configure-lxr.pl: NEW - NEW - NEW
----------------
Script to configure lxr.conf and databases. Having an operational LXR is now
only a matter of a few minutes.

recreatedb.pl: NEW - NEW - NEW
--------------
Script to recreate databasese descriptions from lxr.conf instead of
reconfiguring everything from scratch with configure-lxr.pl above.
Useful e.g. after a system upgrade when the dbengine has been replaced
(provided you backuped at least the LXR root directory).

Git.pm
------
Git support operational! Use of CPAN module git.pm given up; interactions
with git have been recoded.

Plain.pm
--------
Performance improvement on plain files source-trees: file
copying suppressed.
Improvement also when diff'ing two files but not noticeable since diff
is rather rare and used on a single file at a time.

Subversion.pl: NEW - NEW - NEW
--------------
Adds support for Subversion VCS.
Repository restricted to directory in the local file system, no network
access allowed.

Index.pm, DB drivers and DB templates
-------------------------------------
Rewritten to better take benefit of SQL standardisation; record reference
counts added in the tables to facilitate individual version removal;
queries optimised to improve indexing speed (or, at least, not to
slow it despite the new fields and key checks)
												=> reindexing required

SQLite.pm
---------
New database interface (for small projects): avoids the pain of installing
a full-fledged DB server at the cost of lower performance.

search script
------
'Case sensitive' check box now effective (with glimpse since swish-e is
always case-insensitive).
Role of 'advanced' box clarified: applies only to file name.
												=> no impact on indexing

diff script
----
Can now compare two files (with basically the same "virtual" name) differing
in any number of variables (not only 'v') if that makes sense.
Note: this is only possible with "buttons-and-menus" interface.
												=> no impact on indexing

genxref script
-------
Progress output reduced and reorganized with color highlighting
to be useful (see User's Manual)

Languages
---------
Scanners and definitions improved (notably JavaScript, Perl, PHP and Python;
'href=' and the like hyperlinked in HTML files)
												=> reindex for new keywords
												   otherwise no impact

lxr.conf
--------
Parameter 'maps' changed from 'Perl-hash' to mere 'array' so that order
of rule application can be controlled.
Variables can now have a 'when' attribute to display them only
when they are relevant to current context.
												=> no impact on indexing

lxr.css
-------
Color syntax highlighting changed to Peter Zotov's settings. Thanks to him
for spending the time to find much nicer colors (in my opinion, but that's
personal taste). Classic colors still available in classic.css.
												=> no impact on indexing

Config.pm
---------
Modified to handle new 'maps' type.
This allows also to "reverse" the effects of the rules and compute an
associated file name when variables are changed (at least if rules are not
too complex).
												=> no impact on indexing

New lxrkernel.conf template and kernel-grab-vars.sh script
    --------------              -------------------
Provided as goodies to help configuring for the Linux kernel

        =======================
        LXR 0.10  -->  LXR 0.11
        =======================

This version begins reorganizing the root directory. As a user remarked, it is becoming a mess.
New subdirectories are created:

- doc: for release documentation
- lxrconf.d: all active configuration files go here
             as well as all user-customised templates
- LXRimages: all pics and graphic files
- scripts: shell scripts to ease installation
- templates: all models sorted in
	+ Apache  : files related to Apache web server configuration and operation
	+ html    : the traditional HTML templates
	+ initdb  : templates to create the databases
	+ lighttpd: files related to lighttpd web server configuration and
	            operation
	+(no dir) : assorted files which couldn't be stored in the above
	           directories

Should remain in the root directory only the main Perl script files
(to be accessed by the web server) and the final lxr.conf.


Support for fast switching between trees when multiple sources managed.

Reliable dynamic link reconfiguration when changing variable value
(think of 'version' and 'architecture').

Experimental support for lighttpd web server.

Browsed tree target determined independently from access port, but port
should still be configured in 'host_names' if you want a default applied
to generated links.

New script showconfig to display lxr.conf content and help diagnose
configuration issues.

Installation: new scripts to relieve some pain in configuring
============= web server and database.


Configuration files: if not modified, can be used from the templates
                     subdirectories; otherwise must be stored in
                     lxrconf.d directory

lxr.conf:*files controlled by scripts now use OS-absolute path form
--------  for better reliability; penalty: in the rare event you move
          your LXR root directory, configuration must be redone
          from start, unless you first tailored the template.
         *new parameters 'swishconf' (location was hard-coded!),
          'alternate_stylesheet'
         *new parameter 'filetypeconf' pointing to file/parser associations

generic.conf: reorganised so that future fiddling with supported
------------  languages will have no impact on existing databases
              (read: language id is guaranteed to remain fixed --
              unless ctags undergoes drastic changes, of course)

filetype.conf: new file; content was formerly inside lxr.conf but was
-------------  rarely modified, anyway by the end-user. This makes
               lxr.conf smaller and more easily manageable by end-user.


CSS class attribute name changes
Substitution marker name (in HTML templates) changes
												=> no impact
			(unless you developed your own templates and lxr.css)

        =========================
        LXR 0.9.10  -->  LXR 0.10
        =========================

This version contains new features.

The menus-and-buttons interface is considered mature enough to be offered for general release.

lxr.conf
--------
New and simpler way of entering the URL of your server with 'host_names'
'baseurl' and 'baseurl_aliases' kept for compatibility
												=> no impact (unless you want to use this new feature)
Custom icons may be used in directory listing	=> no impact (unless you want to use this new feature)

lxr.css
-------
More class'es to fine grained control over display

Common.pm
---------
File was becoming too big -- split into Template.pm, Markup.pm and Common.pm
												=> no impact on indexing

templates/
----------
Template redesigned and new functions added		=> no impact unless you had custom templates
												=> no impact on indexing

html-ident-refs.html removed (now integrated in html-ident.html)
												=> update your customised lxr.conf
												=> no impact if using released lxr.conf
												=> no impact on indexing

ident and search scripts
-----     ------
Results are now presented in tabular form for better readability
												=> no impact on indexing

Languages
---------
JavaScript and Ruby added						=> re-index your tree


genxref script
-------
Tests added to detect trivial errors
  genxref step is done early in the installation/configuration process. This is the appropriate place to detect elementary errors. To see the tests result uncluttered, add --checkonly on the command line
												=> safer installation
												=> no impact on indexing

        ==========================
        LXR 0.9.9  -->  LXR 0.9.10
        ==========================

This version is mainly a bug fix release.

Change in generic parser for string was too specific and could result in loss of synchronisation under certain circumstances (i.e. string interpreted as code and code considered as string). Thanks to users feed-back, C, C++, Perl and Python are validated.

It contains partial implementation of features announced for 0.10. DO NOT RELY on them, they are unstable.

For up-to-date information, connect to http://lxr.sourceforge.net

        =========================
        LXR 0.9.8  -->  LXR 0.9.9
        =========================

lxr.conf
--------
File restructured for more logical reading		=> no impact

Parameter 'graphicfile'
  More file extensions considered "graphic"		=> no impact on indexing
	May prevent indexing if extensions used for something non graphic;
	in that case, modify parameter
  Parameter now used both to tag file as graphic in directory listing
  and attempting to display it (consistency)	=> no impact on indexing
  Pattern simplified: match at end of file name now implicit
	May not give you what you expect if you used untypical pattern
	testing something in the middle of the file name.
	In that case, report as a bug or a feature request
	for general test on any part of the filename.

Parameter 'filetype'
  Default tab width changed for some languages	=> no impact on indexing
	Changes the appearance of source listing

New parameters 'treeextract' and 'encoding'		=> no impact on indexing

lxr.css and templates
---------------------
Many more class'es to give more control on appearance	=> no impact on indexing

New template html-fatal.html (error recovery)	=> no impact on indexing

Language parsing
----------------
Parser in SimpleParse.pm improved so as not to lose context
in languages with escape rules (such as C/C++ and Perl). As a
consequence captures more identifiers

Impact of change not validated outside C, C++ and Perl. Please
report any abnormal parsing, particularly regarding "escape"
sequences (think of \" in C-strings). Abnormal parsing means not
classifying correctly a fragment of file as comment, string, include
or code, or not giving it the correct extent, not missing an identifier.

(CAUTION: identifier recognition is first dependent on ctags
  capability during genxref step; thus a missed identifier
  may be the result of it unknown to the database and the
  parser cannot then be blamed.)

generic.conf
------------
File restructured								=> no impact on indexing

Syntax changed for language specification
  'langid' changed (but C and C++)				=> reindex if other languages
  new 'identdef' to define an identifier		=> no impact on indexing
	Gives you more control on what is an identifier and reserved keyword
  'spec' syntax changed
	May capture more identifiers
	If you made modifications, read manual before merging your
	changes; in particular, 'atom' rule may no longer be needed.
												=> reindex if deemed worth

find script
-----------
Removed find script and html-find.html template as they were no longer
integrated inside LXR and replaced by search.

No impact unless you customised find and want to merge your changes in
search and associated templates.
