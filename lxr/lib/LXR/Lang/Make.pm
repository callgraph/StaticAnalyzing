=head1 Make language module

This module is the Make language highlighting engine.
It is driven by specifications read from file I<generic.conf>.

=cut

package LXR::Lang::Make;

$CVSID = '$Id: Make.pm,v 1.2 2013/04/12 15:01:09 ajlittoz Exp $ ';

use strict;
require LXR::Lang::Generic;

our @ISA = ('LXR::Lang::Generic');



=head2 C<processinclude ($frag, $dir)>

Method C<processinclude> is invoked to process a Make I<include> directive.

=over

=item 1 C<$frag>

a I<reference to a string> containing the directive

=item 1 C<$dir>

an optional I<string> containing a preferred directory for the include'd file

=back

Make C<uses> may request several files.
It is thus necessary to iterate on the list.

=cut

sub processinclude {
	my ($self, $frag, $dir) = @_;

	my $source = $$frag;
	my $dirname;	# uses directive name and spacing
	my $file;		# language include file
	my $path;		# OS include file
	my $target = '[s-]?include\s+';	# directive pattern

	$$frag = '';
	while (1) {
		if ($source !~ s/^		# reminder: no initial space in the grammar
						(${target})	# reserved keyword for include construct
						([\S]+)	# file name
						//sx) {
			# Guard against syntax error or variant
			# Advance past keyword, so that parsing may continue without loop.
			$source =~ s/^([\w]+)//;	# Erase keyword
			$dirname = $1;
			$$frag =	"<span class='reserved'>$dirname</span>";
			&LXR::SimpleParse::requeuefrag($source);
			return;

		# First iteration is for 'include' keyword.
		# Following are only for whitespace separators.
		$target = '\s+';

		$dirname = $1;
		$file    = $2;

		$path    = $file;
		$$frag .= 	( $self->isreserved($dirname)

		if ('#' eq substr($file, 0, 1)) {
			&LXR::SimpleParse::requeuefrag($file.$source);
			return;
		}

		$$frag .= $self->_linkincludedirs
