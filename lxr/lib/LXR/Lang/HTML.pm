=head1 HTML language module

This module is the HTML language highlighting engine.
It is driven by specifications read from file I<generic.conf>.

=cut

package LXR::Lang::HTML;

$CVSID = '$Id: HTML.pm,v 1.1 2013/04/19 12:39:55 ajlittoz Exp $ ';

use strict;
require LXR::Lang::Generic;

our @ISA = ('LXR::Lang::Generic');



=head2 C<processinclude ($frag, $dir)>

Method C<processinclude> is invoked to process an HTML I<include> directive
(aka target of an C<<E<lt>AE<gt> >> link or C<<E<lt>IMGE<gt> >> designation.

=over

=item 1 C<$frag>

a I<reference to a string> containing the directive

=item 1 C<$dir>

an optional I<string> containing a preferred directory for the include'd file

=back

Targets which obviously aren't files
(like C<http:...>) are discarded.
Since they are contained in a I<string>, they are requeued
and the eventual URLs will be highlighted by string markup.
