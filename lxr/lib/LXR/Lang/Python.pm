=head1 Perl language module

This module is the Python language highlighting engine.

It shares most of its methods with I<Generic.pm>.
It only overrides C<processinclude> for efficiency.

=cut

package LXR::Lang::Python;

$CVSID = '$Id: Python.pm,v 1.9 2013/04/12 15:01:09 ajlittoz Exp $ ';

use strict;
use LXR::Common;
use LXR::Lang;
require LXR::Lang::Generic;

our @ISA = ('LXR::Lang::Generic');


=head2 C<processinclude ($frag, $dir)>

Method C<processinclude> is invoked to process a Python I<include> directive.

=over

=item 1 C<$frag>

a I<string> containing the directive

=item 1 C<$dir>

an optional I<string> containing a preferred directory for the include'd file

=back

This method does not reference the configuration file.
However, the different reg-exps are still maintained there
as check case for the generic parser.
