required to transform the file from C<$release1> to C<$release2>
version.

a I<string> containing the filename

a I<string> containing the final version

=head2 C<dirempty ($pathname, $releaseid)>

C<dirempty> returns 1 (I<true>) if the directory is empty,
0 (I<false>) otherwise.

=over

=item 1 C<$pathname>

a I<string> containing the path

=item 1 C<$releaseid>

the release (or version) in which C<$pathname> is expected to
be found

=back

To determine if C<$pathname> is empty, the files contained therein are
checked for a valid revision and directories are recursively explored.
A valid revision is sufficient to decide non-empty directory.

If the algorithm reaches the end of content, directory is empty.

Contained subdirectories or files are not excluded by C<'ignoredirs'>
or C<'ignorefiles'> filters to give a visual feedback of directory
existence.
These subdirectories or files will be effectively excluded when
displaying the directory.

	return 1;
}

=head2 C<cleanstring ($in)>

C<cleanstring> returns its argument with all "dangerous" characters removed.

=over

=item 1 C<$in>

I<String> to clean

=back

"Dangerous" characters are those which have special meaning for the shell
such as C<$> (starting substitution), C<;> (statement separator), &hellip;

This is rather brute force since sophisticated escape rules could be
designed to leave full freedom to the user.
But till now, nobody complained.

	return $out;
}

=head2 C<allreleases ($filename)>

C<allreleases> returns a list of all I<releases> available for the designated
file.

=over

=item 1 C<$filename>

A I<string> containing the filename

=back

A I<release> is not a numeric I<revision>, it is specific user symbol.
It is a tag usually associated with a software release,
but may also name a branching point.

Two files with the same I<release> tag are in a consistent state.

For files, the list is extracted from C<'symbols'> control information.
Since CVS does not manage directory version, the release is arbitrarily
made of the C<'v'> URL argument (if it exists) and the default value
of variable C<'v'>.

=cut

sub allreleases {
	my ($self, $filename) = @_;

	$self->parsecvs($filename);

	if (exists $cvs{'header'}{'symbols'}) {
		return sort keys %{ $cvs{'header'}{'symbols'} };
	} else {
	# no header symbols for a directory, so we use the default and the current release
		my @releases;
		push @releases, $$LXR::Common::HTTP{'param'}{'v'} if $$LXR::Common::HTTP{'param'}{'v'};
		push @releases, $config->vardefault('v');
		return @releases;
	}
}

=head2 C<allrevisions ($filename)>

C<allrevisions> returns a list of all I<revisions> available for the designated
file.

=over

=item 1 C<$filename>

A I<string> containing the filename

=back

A I<revision> is a dot-separated set of numbers.
It is automatically generated by CVS at commit time.

I<Revision> numbers between files are not correlated.

For files, the list is extracted from C<'branch'> control information.
It is empty for directories.

=cut

sub allrevisions {
	my ($self, $filename) = @_;

	$self->parsecvs($filename);

	return sort byrevision keys(%{ $cvs{'branch'} });
}

=head2 C<byrevision ($a, $b)>

C<byrevision> is an auxiliary compare function for C<sort>.

=over

=item 1 C<$a>

=item 1 C<$b>

I<Strings> to compare (CVS revision numbers)

=back

I< This is an "ordinary" function, not a method
(no> C<$self> I<first argument).>

=cut

# sort by CVS version
sub byrevision {
	# Split rev numbers into arrays
	my @one = split /\./, $a;
	my @two = split /\./, $b;
	# Compare each array element, returning as soon as we find a difference
	for (my $i = 0; $i <= $#one; $i++) {
		my $ret = $one[$i] <=> $two[$i];
		return $ret if $ret;
	}

	# If still no difference after we ran through all elements of @one,
	# compare the length of the array
	return $#one <=> $#two;
}


=head2 C<parsecvs ($filename)>

C<parsecvs> builds a hash C<%cvs> which summarises control information
contained in the CVS difference file C<$filename>.

=over

=item 1 C<$filename>

A I<string> containing the filename

=back

B<Caveat:>

=over

=item

This method is indirectly recursive through C<toreal>.
Special precaution must be taken against infinite recursion.

=back

C<parsecvs> parses a CVS difference file
(a bit like I<rlog> does when listing content, but much less
thoroughly). It stops when it reaches the text.
Ideally, an I<rcs> tool would be better.

It is critical for good operation of CVS class.
